## Introduction

Get ready to dive into a groundbreaking study that will blow your mind - we're all about detecting cardiac arrhythmias with a lightweight deep learning neural network!  Our mission is crystal clear: we want to detect atrial fibrillation (AF) from normal sinus rhythm (NSR) using a neural network that's perfect for mobile devices with limited computational resources. Say goodbye to complexity and hello to efficiency! 

Picture this: 30-second ECG interval segments as our secret weapon for classification. Clinically recognized AF episodes last at least 30 seconds, so we've got the perfect timeframe for the job. Plus, we're transforming these segments into images - it's like a creative ECG art project!  But wait, there's more! We're not stopping at AF detection. We've got a whole squad of arrhythmias to classify, including premature atrial and ventricular contractions (PAC and PVC). These sneaky conditions can lead to AF gradually, and PAC is known as the "Silent Killer" - so we're on a mission to expose them! 

Our study has got a heart of gold. We're here to make a real difference for those living in rural areas, where access to cardiology specialists and monitoring equipment is limited. With our lightweight neural network and portable ECG access, detecting abnormal heart rhythms becomes a breeze - even for COVID-19 patients requiring constant monitoring. The future of healthcare is looking brighter already! Early arrhythmia detection means better treatment outcomes and enhanced options for doctors. We're talking about a whole new level of patient care and medical research advancement! 

Join us on this epic journey as we revolutionize arrhythmia detection using cutting-edge technology. Our impact is going to be huge, especially for underserved communities lacking advanced healthcare. We're all about making lives better and leaving no one behind. Let's embark on this exciting adventure together!

With just a simple command, you'll be all set to explore the fascinating world of cardiac arrhythmia detection. No more hassle of figuring out which libraries to install or worrying about compatibility issues. 

## Data Source
#### Long-Term Atrial Fibrillation (LTAF) database

It's like a treasure trove of ECG data regarding to Atrial Fibrillation, collected from physionet.org, with 84 records of around 24-hour long ECG recordings, all with a sampling frequency of 128 Hz. Each of these records comes with annotations for beat and rhythm type.These labels are pure gold, making our algorithm development and testing a breeze. Let's toast to smooth data analysis!
PhysioNet for hooking us up with their user-friendly wfdb Python library. The LTAF database treats us to five types of beat annotations: N for Normal Sinus Rhythm, A for premature atrial contraction, V for premature ventricular contraction, Q for unknown beat, and ' " ' for missing beat. On the rhythm side, we've got nine types of annotations to play with. For this one, we're zooming in on the heart-stealers - atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm for rhythm-based annotation, and normal beat, premature atrial contraction, and premature ventricular contraction for beat-wise annotation.

## Preprocessing

We're taking raw ECG signals and turning them into something more useable. It all starts with noise filtering. Those pesky interferences like powerline interferences, baseline wanders, and electromyographic noises are no match for us. We use a 5th order high-pass Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of 0.5 Hz to kick baseline wander to the curb. And the 60 Hz powerline interference? We say "bye-bye" to that with a band stop filter centered at 60 Hz.
Once we've got our pristine signals, it's time for data transformation. From the detected QRS complexes, we create individual beats within the 30-second segment are plotted on a clean white background, overlaying those plotted beat images to form a single synchronized beat image. With this image transformation, the difference between arrhythmias and NSR becomes crystal clear. Regular NSR beats show noticeable P, Q, R, S, and T waves.
